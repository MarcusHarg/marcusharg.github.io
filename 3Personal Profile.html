	<h1>ITT Assessment 1</h1>
	<h2>Section 4 - Personal Profile</h2>

	<h3>16 Personalities - Myers-Briggs test</h3>
	
	<img src="INPUT RESULT HERE">
	
	<p><strong>This test gave me an ISTP profile, meaning I am introverted, sensing, thiking and perceiving.</strong></p>
	
	<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I like to work predominantly alone as I m introverted however I am also able to be open minded and work in teams if need be. </p>
	<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team scenario I won't be the one to put my hand up as leader or organiser, I am more than happy to be assigned a task and complete that as much as I can alone.</p>
	<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I think I should look for people that are more extroverted as we may work well together as they may be much more comfortable to talk and take a leadership position and delegate roles. I won't argue with them as much as to extroverts together would.</p>
	

	<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
	
	<p>
	<strong>This test told me that I am predominantly a Visual learner. This means that I learn by reading or seeing things rather than listening or doing.</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I would need to learn through visualising, reading, seeing.</p>
	<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? I think in a team scenario it would be better for someone to show me what they have done instead of explain it.</p>
	<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team it would be best to team with people who learn in a similar way and that way we would all be on the same page and know what eachother needs to learn and work effectively as a team. </p>


	<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
	
	<p>
	<strong>This test gave me the highest scores in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness, while giving me low scores in Extroversion and Neuroticism.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you? To me this test outlines that I am easy going and generally not too fussed about things. I am however quite introverted as explained by the low score in extroversion. </p>
	<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team I am not one to argue and am generally happy to do what the team wants. I will put my opinions out there is asked but won't usually speak if I dont fell that I need to. </p>
	<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I would look again for people that are more extroverted but are also open and conscientious. I would avoid people with high scores in neuroticism. </p>
