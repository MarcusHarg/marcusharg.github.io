	<p>This position is for a financial planner who helps people generally of older ages prepare and build savings for retirement, as well as assist with younger families with things such as budgeting and superannuation. This is appealing to me as it is the profession I am looking to go into once I complete my bachelor's degree in business and financial planning.</p>
	<p>Ideally to get to this position I would need some years experience in the financial planning field and also be able to help the business grow with new business. Currently I am working as a paraplanner in a financial planning firm and have been for 3 years. I have no other experience which is why I am studying in order to gain knowledge towards my goal. I am currently studying part time and have 4 years of part time study left.</p>
	<p>I plan to keep working in and around the financial planning field as a paraplanner and also continue my studies and therefore once completed my degree I will have a large amount of experience and hopefully be much more employable than another graduate with little to no experience.</p>
