	<h2>Section 5 - Project Idea: Virtual Reality Gaming Helmet</h2>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The project I would like to put forward is one that I am interested in as I believe it is the future of gaming in our society. It may not be able to be produced within the next 5 years however the ground work has already been invented and I think that this idea is something that will become a reality in the years to come. Virtual Reality gaming.</p>
	<p>At present there are many headsets that use virtual reality, one of which is the Oculus Rift. These gaming tools offer an experience so unique, however they are only in the early stages and not very popular due to it not being 'life-like'. </p>
	<p>I propose an upgraded version of this that allows the user to step into a vitual reality environment that puts you in a virtual body to allow you to do anything you ever wanted to do. A completely different world.</p>
	
	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>For me, like many other gaming enthusiasts we are always looking for something new and fresh. I think this would be the next step in gaming and would be incredible. Imagine if you could step into a virtual world and feel like you were actually there? </p>
	<p>Real places around the world, real people, in a virtual setting? At present there is nothing like this available to the public and my project would help people reach the world from their couch.</p>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>So, the product would be like an oculus rift, however I envision a full helmet design where you can put it on and reach a new world. There would be settings built in that would allow you to pick which mode that you would like to play. Whether you are looking for a specific thrill-seeking activity such as sky diving or whether you were looking to visit a country or place. Or, you may just want to be put into an ‘open world’ where you can go and do whatever, whenever you like. </p>
	
	<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
	
	<h3>Skills Required</h3>
	<p>Gaming software would need to be used and created by a skilled professional.</p>
	<p></p>

	<h3>Outcome</h3>
	<p>If this project were to be successful, the outcome would mean that people would be able to purchase this product and have the world at their fingertips. Instead of travelling overseas, you can ‘travel overseas’ from your couch and meet real people in a virtual setting. It’s virtually the same thing! </p>
	<p>I think this could potentially have negative effects, such as virtual crime and an increase in sedentary behaviour when using, however there would be ways in which you could put in the programming to limit crime and ban players who use the game the wrong way.</p>
