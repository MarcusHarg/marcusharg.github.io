Personal Info
My name is Marcus Hargreaves, RMIT student number s3735636, s3735636@student.rmit.edu.au. 
GitHub Repositaory URL: 
GitHub Pages URL: 
Born and raised in Australia in a Christian family. Completed year 12 in 2015 and have been working at a financial planning firm since 2017. 
My first year of local senior footy is the year Brendan Fevola came to my home town and played for us. He was here for 3 years which was a great experience. My partner and I live with my parents and are in the process of building our own house!

Interest in IT:
My interest in IT isn't a major part in why I chose to do this course. I have grown up with IT surrounding me from a young age and therefore know my way around the basic computers and phones however have never delved any deeper into how everything works. I recently became interested in gaming PC's and recently purchased and built my own PC but haven't worked with coding or anything more advanced before. I have close to no IT experience, however in my job we use excel spreadsheets daily, as well as outlook functions and things, so I have some general knowledge about how things work. 
I came to RMIT because they were able to give me the opportunity to work through Open Universities Australia and study whilst working full time as well as everything else going on in my life. They give you the flexibility to be able to watch lectures or do things at home online whenever it is convenient to you. 
From this subject I expect to get a greater understanding of technologies in the world and how they affect everyday life and how they may affect life in the future as well. 

Ideal Job: http://www.belmores.com.au/files/docs/financial%20planner.pdf 
This position is for a financial planner who helps people generally of older ages prepare and build savings for retirement, as well as assist with younger families with things such as budgeting and superannuation. This is appealing to me as it is the profession I am looking to go into once I complete my bachelor's degree in business and financial planning.
Ideally to get to this position I would need some years experience in the financial planning field and also be able to help the business grow with new business. Currently I am working as a paraplanner in a financial planning firm and have been for 3 years. I have no other experience which is why I am studying in order to gain knowledge towards my goal. I am currently studying part time and have 4 years of part time study left.
I plan to keep working in and around the financial planning field as a paraplanner and also continue my studies and therefore once completed my degree I will have a large amount of experience and hopefully be much more employable than another graduate with little to no eperience. 

Personal Profile:
Myer's Briggs Test: 
This test gave me an ISTP profile, meaning I am introverted, sensing, thiking and perceiving. 
What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I like to work predominantly alone as I m introverted however I am also able to be open minded and work in teams if need be. 
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team scenario I won't be the one to put my hand up as leader or organiser, I am more than happy to be assigned a task and complete that as much as I can alone.
How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I think I should look for people that are more extroverted as we may work well together as they may be much more comfortable to talk and take a leadership position and delegate roles. I won't argue with them as much as to extroverts together would. 

Learning Style Test:
This test told me that I am predominantly a Visual learner. This means that I learn by reading or seeing things rather than listening or doing. 
What do the results of these tests mean for you? The results of this test mean that I would need to learn through visualising, reading, seeing.
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? I think in a team scenario it would be better for someone to show me what they have done instead of explain it.
How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team it would be best to team with people who learn in a similar way and that way we would all be on the same page and know what eachother needs to learn and work effectively as a team. 

Big Five Personality Test:
This test gave me the highest scores in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness, while giving me low scores in Extroversion and Neuroticism. 
What do the results of these tests mean for you? To me this test outlines that I am easy going and generally not too fussed about things. I am however quite introverted as explained by the low score in extroversion. 
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? In a team I am not one to argue and am generally happy to do what the team wants. I will put my opinions out there is asked but won't usually speak if I dont fell that I need to. 
How should you take this into account when forming a team? When forming a team I would look again for people that are more extroverted but are also open and conscientious. I would avoid people with high scores in neuroticism. 

Project Idea: 

The project I would like to put forward is one that I am interested in as I believe it is the future of gaming in our society. It may not be able to be produced within the next 5 years however the ground work has already been invented and I think that this idea is something that will become a reality in the years to come. Virtual Reality gaming. 
At present there are many headsets that use virtual reality, one of which is the Oculus Rift. These gaming tools offer an experience so unique, however they are only in the early stages and not very popular due to it not being 'life-like'. 
I propose an upgraded version of this that allows the user to step into a vitual reality environment that puts you in a virtual body to allow you to do anything you ever wanted to do. A completely different world.

Motivation:  
For me, like many other gaming enthusiasts we are always looking for something new and fresh. I think this would be the next step in gaming and would be incredible. Imagine if you could step into a virtual world and feel like you were actually there? Real places around the world, real people, in a virtual setting? At present there is nothing like this available to the public and my project would help people reach the world from their couch.  
 
Description:  
So, the product would be like an oculus rift, however I envision a full helmet design where you can put it on and reach a new world. There would be settings built in that would allow you to pick which mode that you would like to play. Whether you are looking for a specific thrill-seeking activity such as sky diving or whether you were looking to visit a country or place. Or, you may just want to be put into an ‘open world’ where you can go and do whatever, whenever you like.  
Tools and Technologies: 
 
Skills Required:  
 Gaming software would need to be used and created by a skilled professional.

Outcome:  
If this project were to be successful, the outcome would mean that people would be able to purchase this product and have the world at their fingertips. Instead of travelling overseas, you can ‘travel overseas’ from your couch and meet real people in a virtual setting. It’s virtually the same thing! I think this could potentially have negative effects, such as virtual crime and an increase in sedentary behaviour when using, however there would be ways in which you could put in the programming to limit crime and ban players who use the game the wrong way.
